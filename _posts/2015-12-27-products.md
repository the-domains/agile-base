# Membership organisations

With our fist membership customers the Chartered Institute or Patent Attorneys and Play More Golf, we've crafted systems to deal with all aspects of membership organisations, from sales, to running events, exams, signups and renewals. Building on the agile:base platform means systems can be completely customised and grown to fit to each individual organisation.
