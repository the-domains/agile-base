# Pricing

Affordable and transparent pricing that means you only pay for what you need. Choose from a standard package:

# Grow

Perfect for small startups or individual departments on tight budgets

* 10 users, 10k records, 10 tables, 10GB storage
* £450 per month

Enough to create applications for a department or team that can revolutionise their world

# Change

Ideal for companies who need to support existing systems while they plan for future change

* 25 users, 250k records, 25 tables, 25GB storage
* £750 per month

Combine multiple applications with shared data to take advantage of communication and learning across the organisation

# Evolve

A larger package for established businesses that are still growing or evolving.

Utilise agile:base from top to bottom across the entire organisation or group of companies. Fixed additional charges per user and quantity of data mean that expansion can be planned with affordable and easily understood costs.

What's more, because of agile:base's fast, friendly and flexible application building tools, apps can be built internally with no expensive consultants. Where you do wish to use us or our partners to build apps for you, build time is massively reduced compared to using traditional software.
