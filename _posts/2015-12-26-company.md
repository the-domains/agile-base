# Company

agile:base is owned by agileChilli Ltd. The company was [formed in 2015][0] by the 'merger by acquisition' of Chilli Consulting into agileBase Ltd.

Both Chilli Consulting and agileBase were long-standing, successful organisations with great track records from their customers. agile:base as a platform allowed organisations to create modern, scalable, cloud-based applications to run their enterprises but needed to specialise in order to reach wider markets.

Chilli Consulting had the knowledge, experience and expertise to take advantage of one growing market - software for the food industry. Mark Garrett is now Head of Food at agileChilli, expanding that area of the business.

agile:base continues to grow into other markets where it's found a particular resonance, the other key area being membership organisations, who have requirements for CRM, sales and membership management not met by other providers.
