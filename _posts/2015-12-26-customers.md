The Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys wanted a 'not-a-membership-database'!

> We see membership bodies and associations as being about much more than membership. We employ people. We buy stuff. We sell stuff. We manage knowledge. We are businesses and we need to manage data across the business. I was looking for a total business solution and the only approach that came close to meeting my needs was AgileBase.

Lee Davies, Chief Executive

The benefits of agileBase for CIPA are that it's

* **flexible**

- the system provides the flexibility necessary to meet CIPA's unique needs. It's able to match exactly the processes they want to use for e.g. membership renewals and event bookings, not have processes forced on them by 'packaged' software
* **fast**

- new modules can be created very rapidly on demand, as the system expands in scope to deal with new areas of the organisation, like HR
* **friendly**

- the user interface is so intuitive that it's a joy to work with. New users can be on-boarded with a minimum of fuss

[big thanks to the guys at @agilebase for building a wicked not-a-membership-database][0]

# Play More Golf

A unique service for golfers linking clubs across the UK under one flexible golf membership to provide players with more choice, value and flexibility.PMG was founded by the same team who launched and ran The De Vere Club. The founders built a membership base of 18,000 members over four years and understand what a golfer and golf club wants.

> At Play More Golf we offer a simple cost effective way for golfers to enjoy the benefits of being a flexible member with ability to use their membership at a variety of clubs. The traditional membership systems we looked at couldn't cope with our needs and as a new business we didn't want to build a bespoke system from scratch. agile:Mem offered us the best of both worlds

With Lewis' growth in turnover over recent years, they're taking the opportunity to turbo-charge their sales targets, approach and technology for the future.
They realised they'd need agileBase's flexibility, communications capabilities and speed of delivery to help see through their ambition.
