We take security incredibly seriously, because we understand the importance of your data. That's why we ensure that all our hosting providers follow a comprehensive data security protocol, and have fail-safe redundancy built in.

A variety of industry standard, best practice systems put layers of security between your data and the end user. We always consider what more we can do in terms of data security. In addition to the above password protections, measures include

* Two-factor authentication using your phone
* Immediate notifications of logins from new geographic areas or on new devices 
* Full access and data modification audit trails
* Comprehensive roles and privileges system
* Password encryption in the database
* Firewall, intrusion detection and operating system security
