# Technology

How have we built a platform which is so fast, flexible, usable and affordable? By standing on the shoulders of the some of the giants of the open source world.

On top of these core open source components, we've added 26 man-years of our own development to produce the ultimate user experience for both growing startups and enterprises.

# Powerful database engine

[PostgreSQL][0] is the world's most advanced open source database. It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. An enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts many sophisticated features. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate.

# Robust performance guaranteed

Whenever an application is built using agileBase's drag and drop admin features, our system automatically creates and manages a PostgreSQL database 'under the bonnet'.

A simple app may take only minutes to build, but you're automatically benefitting from that built in scalability. Should you decide to let thousands of users loose on it or add millions of data records, it's all covered.

# Lightning Fast Development

To access all these powerful features, you don't need to have a degree in computer science, or indeed any programming knowledge at all, although a logical mind does help! Most features are added automatically when an app is built with our visual administration interface.

However, if any of your IT people do want to get their hands dirty with some snazzy SQL, they can always access the underlying database features directly, or your web designers can create custom output templates.
