# The agile:base platform
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/483cb1c0093d62a13cb7ed47807fe7b625d34202.png)

AgileBase is our flexible cloud-based platform - fast, friendly and flexible.

It provides a massively scalable foundation on which to rapidly build enterprise-class software. There are 26 man-years of development baked in and there's not a lot it can't do.

In fact, it's pretty unique and very powerful.

# Fast

Development takes hours, not months, so you always keep pace with what your company needs

# Friendly

People love using agileBase because it looks stunning and matches their specific requirements

# Flexible

Build bespoke software to meet your current and future business needs

**In short, agile:base delivers business agility through technology.**

# How it works

**Powerful software engine**

agileBase is built on the most advanced open source database in the world, [postgreSQL][0] and we've spent years developing it to be the fastest, most flexible platform possible. It's extremely robust, extraordinarily powerful, and you can use it as a platform to create virtually any software you like. It's designed to be an open platform, so it's easy to connect and integrate with other applications.

**Lightning fast development**

Avoid the long phase of requirements definition and jump straight in. Decide on a few key objectives for the software, and explain what you need it to do, as it's being built. We call it Live Prototyping. What's more, because it's so easy to change and customise, agileBase gives you software that fits your business - not the other way around.

> No programming necessary - drag and drop development!

**Customisable software, today**

Tailored software means it's shaped around the way you do business. No unused fields, no unhelpful reports. Focus on what matters, and never again will your team have to work around software designed for somebody else. Organise the data you need, the way you want, and capture it all seamlessly in agileBase
